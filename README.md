# User Stories
1. Improve control layout + more forgiving bites before death early in the game

  Shooting those damn zombies is hard. Players should be able to shoot more comfortably. Our specs say players die after 2 bites, but players are reporting they die after only one. Players should recognize when they are bitten.

2. Portal tile allows movement to next level + remove timed level switching

  Jumping between levels uncontrollably has been a problem. Create portals between the levels and that allow a player to walk on to bring them to the next level.

3. Improve zombie pathing when near obstacles - they should not get “stuck”

  The monsters are pretty dumb. They get stuck behind walls, even a few feet away from a player. The zombies should no longer get stuck behind every wall.

4. Mini-map

  These levels are huge! Players are reporting going in circles and being lost. Create a mini-map to help them navigate each level.
